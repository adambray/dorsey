# Dorsey

Dorsey is a micro framework for building web apps in Ruby, modeled closely after
Sinatra.

Named after Tommy Dorsey, an early collaborator with Frank Sinatra, and jazz
trombonist

## Using

This library isn't gem-ified yet (coming soon!)

If you want to play with it now, the interface works like Sinatra:

```ruby
get "/" do
  "Hello World!"
end
```
